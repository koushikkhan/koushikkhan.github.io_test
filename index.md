Believe it or not, the advancement in the world of technology is fast-paced. It is difficult to keep track of everything that are happening around us. But most of these advancements are following some fundamentals except for some ground braking inventions. Being strong at fundamentals not only make you stand out among others but also help you to upskill yourself in a far better way while enjoying every bit of the journey. 

The whole intention of putting this website is to share knowledge on various things, starting from technical concepts to real life experiences in a lucid way but not as a problem-solution guide. 

If you like this approach, I am sure you will enjoy the contents.
