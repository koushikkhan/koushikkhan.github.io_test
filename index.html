<p>Believe it or not, the advancement in the world of technology is fast-paced. It is difficult to keep track of everything that are happening around us. But most of these advancements are following some fundamentals except for some ground braking inventions.</p>   

<p>Being strong at fundamentals not only make you stand out among others but also help you to upskill yourself in a far better way while enjoying every bit of the journey.</p>  

<p>The whole intention of putting this website is to share knowledge on various things, starting from technical concepts to real life experiences in a lucid way but mostly not as a problem-solution guide.</p>  

<p>If you like this approach, I am sure you will enjoy the contents.</p> 

<p>This site is divided into multiple sections, below are the details to help you navigate through it.</p>    

<ul>
    <li>:house_with_garden: <b>Home:</b> this is where you are at right now</li>
    <li>:books: <b>Blog:</b> you will find all the articles or posts that I will be sharing</li>
